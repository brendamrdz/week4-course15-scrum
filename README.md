## Introduction to Scrum
### What is Scrum?
Scrum is a framework by which people can address complex adaptive problems while delivering products of the highest possible value productively and creatively.
The essence of Scrum is a small team of people. The individual team is highly flexible and adaptive.
#### Scrum Theory
Scrum is based on empirical process control theory or empiricism. Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is known.


### Pillars of Scrum

### SCRUM components
- **The Scrum Team**: The Scrum Team is self-organizing and cross-functional.
- **Product Owner:** Responsible for maximizing the value of the product.
- **Scrum Master:** Responsible for promoting and supporting Scrum.
- **Development Team:** Professionals who perform the work of delivering a "Finished" product increment.

### Scrum Events
In Scrum there are predefined events in order to create regularity and minimize the need for undefined meetings in Scrum.
- Sprint The heart of Scrum where a product increment is created.
- Sprint planning A ceremony to define what will be done during the sprint.
- Daily stand-up Daily meeting of the entire development team.
- Sprint review Sprint review is where the increment developed during the sprint is shown. 
- Sprint retrospective Opportunity to apply continuous improvement.

### Scrum Artifacts
Scrum artifacts represent work or value in various forms that are useful for providing transparency and opportunities for inspection and adaptation.
- **Product Backlog** An ordered list of everything known to be needed in the product. 
- **Sprint Backlog** Items from the Product Backlog selected for the Sprint.

### Scrum Team
