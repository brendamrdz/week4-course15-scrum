# Scrum
What is Agile?
Agile is the ability to create products and respond to change.


Agile is a set of frameworks and methodologies. People-centric Agile focuses on people and how they work and collaborate.
## Agile Software Development Manifesto
- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Software running** on extensive documentation
- **Collaboration with the customer** over contractual negotiation
- **Response to change** over following a plan

## 12 Agile Principles
1.  Customer Satisfaction Early and continuous delivery of software with value.
2.  Changes Changes are welcome at any stage of the project.
3.  Functional software Delivered frequently, in short periods of time.
4.  Collaboration Business and developers work together.
5.  Motivated individuals The development team must be given a good environment and trust.
6.  Face-to-face communication This is the most efficient and effective method of communicating with the team.
7.  Progress Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8.  Sustainable development The pace of development must be constant indefinitely.
9.  Continuous improvement Through technical excellence and good design.
10.  Simplicity The art of maximizing the amount of work not done is essential.
11.  Self-organization The best architectures, requirements and designs emerge from self-organized teams.
12.  Self-assessment The team is capable of adjusting and refining its behavior.

## Introduction to Scrum
### What is Scrum?
Scrum is a framework by which people can address complex adaptive problems while delivering products of the highest possible value productively and creatively.
The essence of Scrum is a small team of people. The individual team is highly flexible and adaptive.
#### Scrum Theory
Scrum is based on empirical process control theory or empiricism. Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is known.


### Pillars of Scrum
- Transparency
- Inspection
- Adaptation

### Scrum values

### SCRUM components
- **The Scrum Team**: The Scrum Team is self-organizing and cross-functional.
- **Product Owner:** Responsible for maximizing the value of the product.
- **Scrum Master:** Responsible for promoting and supporting Scrum.
- **Development Team:** Professionals who perform the work of delivering a "Finished" product increment.

### Scrum Events
In Scrum there are predefined events in order to create regularity and minimize the need for undefined meetings in Scrum.
- Sprint The heart of Scrum where a product increment is created.
- Sprint planning A ceremony to define what will be done during the sprint.
- Daily stand-up Daily meeting of the entire development team.
- Sprint review Sprint review is where the increment developed during the sprint is shown. 
- Sprint retrospective Opportunity to apply continuous improvement.

### Scrum Artifacts
Scrum artifacts represent work or value in various forms that are useful for providing transparency and opportunities for inspection and adaptation.
- **Product Backlog** An ordered list of everything known to be needed in the product. 
- **Sprint Backlog** Items from the Product Backlog selected for the Sprint.

### Scrum Team
- Product Owner
- Scrum Master
- Development Team

Scrum is designed to optimize flexibility, creativity, and productivity.
Scrum Teams deliver products iteratively and incrementally, maximizing opportunities for feedback.
**Dependencies**: It is ideal to organize teams with a focus on minimizing dependencies on external entities.
**Types of organization**: Teams can be organized based on functionalities or components.

### Product Owner
The Product Owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Development Team. The Product Owner is the sole person responsible for managing the Product List.
Responsibilities:
- Clearly express the elements of the Product List. 
- Prioritize the items on the Product List.
- Optimize the value of the Development Team's work.
- Ensure that the Product List is visible, transparent and clear.
- Ensure that the Development Team is aware of the items on the Product List.
The Product Owner's decisions are reflected in the content and prioritization of the Product List.
No one can force the Development Team to work based on a different set of requirements.

### Scrum Master
The Scrum Master role is responsible for promoting and supporting Scrum by helping everyone understand Scrum theory, practices, rules, and values.
The Scrum Master is a leader who is at the service of the Scrum Team. Helps people outside the Scrum Team understand which interactions with the Scrum Team can be useful and which cannot. 
**The Scrum Master's Role**
- Lead and guide the organization in the adoption of Scrum.
- Work with other Scrum Masters to increase the effectiveness of Scrum application in the organization.
**The Scrum Master's Service to the Product Owner**
- Ensure that the objectives, scope, and product domain are understood by everyone on the team. Scrum in the best possible way.
- Understand and practice agility.
- Facilitate Scrum events as required or needed.
**The Scrum Master's Service to the Development Team**
- Guide the Development Team in being self-organizing and cross-functional.
- Help the Development Team create high value products.
- Remove impediments to the Development Team's progress.
- The Scrum Master's Service to the Organization.

### The Development Team
Consists of the professionals who perform the work of delivering a "Finished" product increment that can potentially be put into production at the end of each Sprint.
The organization is responsible for structuring and empowering the Development Teams to organize and manage their own work.
Characteristics:
- Self-organized.
- Cross-functional.
- No titles.
- No sub-teams.
- Can only be modified at the end of the sprint.
The optimal size of the Development Team is small enough to remain agile and large enough to complete a significant amount of work.

## Epics and the Product Backlog
The Product Backlog is an ordered list of everything known to be needed in the product. It is the only source of requirements for any changes to be made to the product.
The Product Backlog is never complete, it is always being developed as the project progresses. The items on the highest priority list have more complete descriptions.
The Product List is dynamic; it is constantly changing to identify what the product needs to be adequate, competitive and useful.
The Product List is a living artifact, it is constantly changing and all the elements necessary to complete the product reside in it.
The elements of the Product List are called User Stories.
All User Stories can be grouped into larger elements called Epics.
Epics can be created based on functionalities or modules of the product being developed.
These Epics usually require more than one Sprint to be completed.



***If we are developing an LMS system the Epics can be:**
- Authentication module.
- Evaluation module.
- Course creation module.
- Module for student interaction.

**What do User Stories tell us?**
User stories are the most specific elements of the Product List, they contain the user's view of the expected functionality of the product.


**Components of the user story:**
- Title
- Description
- Points
- Acceptance Criteria
**Description:**
- As <rol>
- I want <action>
- For <benefit>
Example:
If we develop an LMS system the epics can be:
- As a student
- I want to be able to complete assessments on the platform.
- To be able to be assessed and have a grade.
  
 The definition of "complete" is the list of elements required to know that a story is complete. Example:
- Functionality. (Acceptance criteria)
- Code uploaded to git.
- Tests created.
- Documentation.
