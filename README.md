# Scrum
What is Agile?
Agile is the ability to create products and respond to change.


Agile is a set of frameworks and methodologies. People-centric Agile focuses on people and how they work and collaborate.
## Agile Software Development Manifesto
- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Software running** on extensive documentation
- **Collaboration with the customer** over contractual negotiation
- **Response to change** over following a plan

## 12 Agile Principles
1.  Customer Satisfaction Early and continuous delivery of software with value.
2.  Changes Changes are welcome at any stage of the project.
3.  Functional software Delivered frequently, in short periods of time.
4.  Collaboration Business and developers work together.
5.  Motivated individuals The development team must be given a good environment and trust.
6.  Face-to-face communication This is the most efficient and effective method of communicating with the team.
7.  Progress Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8.  Sustainable development The pace of development must be constant indefinitely.
9.  Continuous improvement Through technical excellence and good design.
10.  Simplicity The art of maximizing the amount of work not done is essential.
11.  Self-organization The best architectures, requirements and designs emerge from self-organized teams.
12.  Self-assessment The team is capable of adjusting and refining its behavior.

## Introduction to Scrum
### What is Scrum?
Scrum is a framework by which people can address complex adaptive problems while delivering products of the highest possible value productively and creatively.
The essence of Scrum is a small team of people. The individual team is highly flexible and adaptive.
#### Scrum Theory
Scrum is based on empirical process control theory or empiricism. Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is known.


### Pillars of Scrum
- Transparency
- Inspection
- Adaptation

### Scrum values

### SCRUM components
- **The Scrum Team**: The Scrum Team is self-organizing and cross-functional.
- **Product Owner:** Responsible for maximizing the value of the product.
- **Scrum Master:** Responsible for promoting and supporting Scrum.
- **Development Team:** Professionals who perform the work of delivering a "Finished" product increment.

### Scrum Events
In Scrum there are predefined events in order to create regularity and minimize the need for undefined meetings in Scrum.
- Sprint The heart of Scrum where a product increment is created.
- Sprint planning A ceremony to define what will be done during the sprint.
- Daily stand-up Daily meeting of the entire development team.
- Sprint review Sprint review is where the increment developed during the sprint is shown. 
- Sprint retrospective Opportunity to apply continuous improvement.

### Scrum Artifacts
Scrum artifacts represent work or value in various forms that are useful for providing transparency and opportunities for inspection and adaptation.
- **Product Backlog** An ordered list of everything known to be needed in the product. 
- **Sprint Backlog** Items from the Product Backlog selected for the Sprint.

### Scrum Team
- Product Owner
- Scrum Master
- Development Team

Scrum is designed to optimize flexibility, creativity, and productivity.
Scrum Teams deliver products iteratively and incrementally, maximizing opportunities for feedback.
**Dependencies**: It is ideal to organize teams with a focus on minimizing dependencies on external entities.
**Types of organization**: Teams can be organized based on functionalities or components.

#### Product Owner
The Product Owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Development Team. The Product Owner is the sole person responsible for managing the Product List.
Responsibilities:
- Clearly express the elements of the Product List. 
- Prioritize the items on the Product List.
- Optimize the value of the Development Team's work.
- Ensure that the Product List is visible, transparent and clear.
- Ensure that the Development Team is aware of the items on the Product List.
The Product Owner's decisions are reflected in the content and prioritization of the Product List.
No one can force the Development Team to work based on a different set of requirements.

#### Scrum Master
The Scrum Master role is responsible for promoting and supporting Scrum by helping everyone understand Scrum theory, practices, rules, and values.
The Scrum Master is a leader who is at the service of the Scrum Team. Helps people outside the Scrum Team understand which interactions with the Scrum Team can be useful and which cannot. 
**The Scrum Master's Role**
- Lead and guide the organization in the adoption of Scrum.
- Work with other Scrum Masters to increase the effectiveness of Scrum application in the organization.
**The Scrum Master's Service to the Product Owner**
- Ensure that the objectives, scope, and product domain are understood by everyone on the team. Scrum in the best possible way.
- Understand and practice agility.
- Facilitate Scrum events as required or needed.
**The Scrum Master's Service to the Development Team**
- Guide the Development Team in being self-organizing and cross-functional.
- Help the Development Team create high value products.
- Remove impediments to the Development Team's progress.
- The Scrum Master's Service to the Organization.

#### The Development Team
Consists of the professionals who perform the work of delivering a "Finished" product increment that can potentially be put into production at the end of each Sprint.
The organization is responsible for structuring and empowering the Development Teams to organize and manage their own work.
Characteristics:
- Self-organized.
- Cross-functional.
- No titles.
- No sub-teams.
- Can only be modified at the end of the sprint.
The optimal size of the Development Team is small enough to remain agile and large enough to complete a significant amount of work.

### Epics and the Product Backlog
The Product Backlog is an ordered list of everything known to be needed in the product. It is the only source of requirements for any changes to be made to the product.
The Product Backlog is never complete, it is always being developed as the project progresses. The items on the highest priority list have more complete descriptions.
The Product List is dynamic; it is constantly changing to identify what the product needs to be adequate, competitive and useful.
The Product List is a living artifact, it is constantly changing and all the elements necessary to complete the product reside in it.
The elements of the Product List are called User Stories.
All User Stories can be grouped into larger elements called Epics.
Epics can be created based on functionalities or modules of the product being developed.
These Epics usually require more than one Sprint to be completed.



***If we are developing an LMS system the Epics can be:**
- Authentication module.
- Evaluation module.
- Course creation module.
- Module for student interaction.

## What do User Stories tell us?
User stories are the most specific elements of the Product List, they contain the user's view of the expected functionality of the product.


**Components of the user story:**
- Title
- Description
- Points
- Acceptance Criteria


**Description:**
- As (rol)
- I want (action)
- For (benefit)


**Example:**


If we develop an LMS system the epics can be:
- As a student
- I want to be able to complete assessments on the platform.
- To be able to be assessed and have a grade.


  
 The definition of "complete" is the list of elements required to know that a story is complete. Example:
- Functionality. (Acceptance criteria)
- Code uploaded to git.
- Tests created.
- Documentation.


### Estimating user stories
The points in a story are a number that represents several things:
- Complexity of the story
- Amount of work required
- Knowledge required
- Uncertainty
Point values have no connection to any specific unit of measurement.

#### Planning Poker
This is a tool to involve the whole team in story estimation.
You can use different scales:
- Modified Fibonacci (1, 2, 3, 5, 5, 8, 13, 13, 20, 40, 100, ∞ and ?). 
- 2ⁿ (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32...)

- **Speed** This is the total number of user story points completed by the team during a sprint.
- **Capacity** Total number of user stories that can be completed in a future sprint.

### Sprint To Do List
It is a subset of the Product List and contains all the elements that will be developed during the Sprint.
The increment to be developed and the Sprint objectives will depend on these items.
This plan must have enough detail so that the whole team is able to understand it in the daily stand-ups (daily Scrum).
Only the development team can accept additions to the Sprint Backlog. If an item becomes unnecessary in the middle of a sprint, it can be removed from the backlog.

### What is the pace of the team?
The Sprint is the heart of Scrum, it is a set period of time in which a product increment is created. 
- Each Sprint must have a clear objective.
- Any changes within the Sprint must be negotiated between the Product Owner and the Development Team.
- If the Sprint objectives become obsolete, the Sprint may be cancelled.
- Only the Product Owner has the authority to cancel a Sprint.
- It is very rare to cancel a sprint.

#### Planning the Sprint
Here all the work of the Sprint is planned.
- The entire Scrum Team must be present.
- It should not last more than 8 hours (4 week Sprints).
- The Scrum master is in charge of organizing the ceremony.
- During the planning these questions should be answered:
  - What can be delivered at the end of the Sprint?
  - How will this work be accomplished?
  - What can be delivered at the end of the Sprint?
- The highest priority items on the Product List are worked on.
- The objective to be achieved in the Sprint is also discussed.
- In the planning process you need to know the capacity of the team and the speed of the last iteration.

#### How will this be achieved?
- The Product List items selected for the Sprint are analyzed and moved to the Sprint Pending List.
- During this process, effort estimates are made.
- The Product Owner is in charge of clarifying any doubts with any Backlog item.
- Guests may be invited to add value to the discussion of the features.


### Daily Stand-Up
It is a daily meeting of no more than 15 minutes of the Development Team. It is used to plan the next 24 hours of work.
The Scrum Master helps schedule the meeting at the same place at the same time every day. Other people may be present but do not participate.
It optimizes collaboration among team members.
It also helps to measure progress toward meeting the sprint goal.


**Three questions:**
- What did I do yesterday?
- What will I do today?
- Do I have any impediments?

If there are any impediments the Scrum Master will be in charge of helping to resolve them.
If more details are needed about what was discussed the team can meet if necessary.

### Refining Stories
Within Scrum processes it is highly desirable to always have functionality in the Product List ready for implementation.
- It is recommended to have at least one story refining session during the sprint.
- This meeting is organized by the Scrum Master and all members of the Development Team can participate. The Product Owner is always present.
- The objective of the story refinement session is to be able to take the features to be worked on in the next Sprint and to detect any possible doubts or impediments before starting the sprint.
Showing and Learning: Demos and Retrospectives


### Sprint Review
The sprint review always occurs at the end of the sprint, demonstrating the progress of the iteration and the functional product that was built.
Sprint Review is facilitated by the Scrum Master.
It should not last more than 4 hours for one month sprints. For shorter sprints the ceremony should last less time.
At the end of the review you will have an updated product list.
Important, save the presentations and show the developed product.

### Retrospective
It should not last more than 3 hours for a 1 month sprint.
It is facilitated by the Scrum Master.
The entire Scrum Team participates.
Retrospective
*Three questions:**
- What did we do well?
- What did we do not do so well?
- What can we improve?
Based on the answers, the most important elements are identified, solutions are sought and an action plan is created to implement the improvements.
### Team scalability
Scrum is capable of working with projects of 10 people as well as projects of 100 and more. The way Scrum is designed allows to face projects of different levels of complexity.

## Scrum of Scrums
Scrum of Scrums is a meeting where members of all the teams frequently meet and that allows coordinating efforts between the different teams of the organization.
The importance of Communities of Practice
Communities of practice are groups of people who share an interest or passion for something they do and learn to do it better as they interact.
